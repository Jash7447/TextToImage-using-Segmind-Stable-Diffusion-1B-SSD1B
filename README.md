# TextToImage-using-Segmind-Stable-Diffusion-1B-SSD1B

We are using hugging face transformer (Segmind Stable Diffusion 1B (SSD-1B) Model Card) to impliment Text to Image and giving a demo of using it with panel and gradio python libraries.

**Model Description**
The Segmind Stable Diffusion Model (SSD-1B) is a distilled 50% smaller version of the Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), offering a 60% speedup while maintaining high-quality text-to-image generation capabilities. It has been trained on diverse datasets, including Grit and Midjourney scrape data, to enhance its ability to create a wide range of visual content based on textual prompts.

This model employs a knowledge distillation strategy, where it leverages the teachings of several expert models in succession, including SDXL, ZavyChromaXL, and JuggernautXL, to combine their strengths and produce impressive visual outputs.
